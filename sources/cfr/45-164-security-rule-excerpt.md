## 164.306 — Security standards: General rules

> (a) General requirements. Covered entities and business associates must do the following:
> (1) Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all electronic protected health
> information the covered entity or business associate creates, receives, maintains, or
> transmits.
> (2) Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity
> of such information.
> (3) Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are
> not permitted or required under subpart E of this part.
> (4) Ensure compliance with this subpart by its workforce.
> (b) Flexibility of approach. (1) Covered entities and business associates may use any security
> measures that allow the covered entity or business associate to reasonably and appropriately
> implement the standards and implementation specifications as specified in this subpart.
> (2) In deciding which security measures to use, a covered entity or business associate must take
> into account the following factors: (i) The size, complexity, and capabilities of the covered
> entity or business associate. (ii) The covered entity's or the business associate's technical
> infrastructure, hardware, and software security capabilities. (iii) The costs of security
> measures. (iv) The probability and criticality of potential risks to electronic protected health
> information.
> (c) Standards. A covered entity or business associate must comply with the applicable standards
> as provided in this section and in §§ 164.308, 164.310, 164.312, 164.314 and 164.316 with
> respect to all electronic protected health information.
> (d) Implementation specifications. In this subpart: (1) Implementation specifications are
> required or addressable. If an implementation specification is required, the word "Required"
> appears in parentheses after the title of the implementation specification. If an implementation
> specification is addressable, the word "Addressable" appears in parentheses after the title of
> the implementation specification. (2) When a standard adopted in § 164.308, § 164.310, §
> 164.312, § 164.314, or § 164.316 includes required implementation specifications, a covered
> entity or business associate must implement the implementation specifications. (3) When a
> standard adopted in § 164.308, § 164.310, § 164.312, § 164.314, or § 164.316 includes
> addressable implementation specifications, a covered entity or business associate must— (i)
> Assess whether each implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard in
> its environment, when analyzed with reference to the likely contribution to protecting
> electronic protected health information; and (ii) As applicable to the covered entity or
> business associate— (A) Implement the implementation specification if reasonable and
> appropriate; or (B) If implementing the implementation specification is not reasonable and
> appropriate— (1) Document why it would not be reasonable and appropriate to implement the
> implementation specification; and (2) Implement an equivalent alternative measure if reasonable
> and appropriate.
> (e) Maintenance. A covered entity or business associate must review and modify the security
> measures implemented under this subpart as needed to continue provision of reasonable and
> appropriate protection of electronic protected health information, and update documentation of
> such security measures in accordance with § 164.316(b)(2)(iii).

**This is the honest, textual basis for "required vs. addressable"** — a distinction this
curriculum's course should map carefully against Part 11's own all-or-nothing requirements
(already fully taught in `data-integrity-and-records`), since Part 11 has no "addressable"
concept at all. Don't blur the two: Part 11 controls (11.10, 11.50, 11.70, 11.100, 11.200,
11.300, already quoted in full in `data-integrity-and-records`) are simply required or not
applicable; HIPAA Security Rule implementation specifications are explicitly either Required or
Addressable (meaning: assess, then implement or document-and-substitute), a genuinely different
compliance posture.

> security policies and procedures meet the requirements of this subpart.
> (b)(1) Business associate contracts and other arrangements. A covered entity may permit a
> business associate to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health

## Methodological note: mapping to Part 11, honestly

A module comparing these side by side with Part 11 (11.10, 11.50, 11.70, 11.100, 11.200, 11.300 —
already fully quoted in `data-integrity-and-records`) should note genuine overlaps (164.312(a)
unique user ID ≈ 11.100's uniqueness requirement; 164.312(b) audit controls ≈ 11.10(e) audit
trails; 164.312(d) person/entity authentication ≈ 11.200's e-signature identity components) and
genuine differences (Part 11 has no "addressable" concept — a control either applies or it
doesn't; HIPAA's Required/Addressable split has no Part 11 equivalent). Don't flatten the two
into "basically the same rule" — they regulate different things (record integrity/e-signatures
vs. general information security) that happen to overlap on access control and audit logging.

## Not saved — don't assert beyond this excerpt

164.314 (organizational requirements — business associate contracts) and 164.316 (policies,
procedures, and documentation requirements) were not independently fetched. If a module needs
them, fetch and verify first.
